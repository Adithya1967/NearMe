                Kanchipuram, also known as Kanchi, is an ancient city in southern India's Tamil Nadu state. Considered a holy pilgrimage site by Hindus, it is home to many temples. The 8th-century Kailasanathar Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a vast complex with intricate sandstone carvings. Ulagalanda Perumal Temple houses a huge statue of Lord Vishnu. A mango tree in the Ekambareswarar Temple courtyard is thought to be sacred.
